# gulrak/filesystem

> An implementation of C++17 std::filesystem for C++11 /C++14/C++17/C++20 on Windows, macOS, Linux and FreeBSD.

It is used in MaNGOS to allow for an easy filesystem interface without writing everything by ourselves and each OS.  
It aims to be a drop-in-replacement for the official standard, which means if this project upgrades to a newer C++ version, it can be easily exchanged.
